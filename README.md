I was not in the class for week 1 so I didn't work on the texteditor.

R2
Note the work that these release notes talk about was done in week 3 but it seems like a good breaking point based on the requirements.
First of all, I was very impressed by how much the AI was able to do.  First, in order to get the basic text editor I gave it the assignment instructions excluding the extra features and told it to make a text editor similar to "vs code".  When trying to run it I got an error and I posted it into amp and it fixed it.  And in two prompts I got a super good text editor (super good based on the problems I heard others have in class).  It gave me the basic text editor with a ton of working features.  It had the basic ability to edit and select.  It had a ton of shortcuts, saving and opening files, copying, pasting, undo, redo and more.  It also had a little star at the top that indicated whether the file was saved or not, and when it was not saved and the user tried to exit or go to a different file, it had an unsaved changes warning.  It looked super good as well (see the image below).  It also decided to make a side pannel for files, although it doesn't currenlty have a way to change which folder is being viewed.

It did a lot of things right the first time, but there were still some bugs that were found after spending some time interacting with it.  It implemented find and replace with a small bug.  It is fixed now, but originally Find was case-insensitive, Replace was case-insensitive, but Replace All was case-sensitive.  It also implemented a zoom in and out shortcut that worked for everything except the line numbers and when I used this it was impossible to tell when I was back to the original 100% zoom.  I did also have amp implement a ton of tests, but honestly IDK if this means my text editor is any better or not.  After finding the replace all bug I told amp to write tests for that, but they all passed the first time and they were written as if Replace All was supposed to be case-sensitive (which it wasn't).  I ended up doing a regression test for this and called it good.  There are also several other things that don't work how they are supposed to.  I made a list in another file (./Saved Text Files/Text Editor Issues and Bugs.txt) but it feels to long to put it all here.
