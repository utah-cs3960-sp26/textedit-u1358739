When I only use find and replace then exit a file, it doesn't warn me about unsaved changes.
When clicking on edit or view in the menu bar, the shortcut description and the shortcut are sometimes overlapping.
To zoom in I have to press ctrlShift+ instead of just ctrl+.

When first opening the text editor it goes off the screen a little until it is repositioned.
When zooming in or out doesn't change the size of the line numbers and they look really bad.

Currently can't change which folder is shown in the side bar.
If something is added to a file then removed, it still shows that the file needs to be saved.
When zooming, it is impossible to tell if I am back at the default 100% or not.

Scroll bar doesn't look that great.
