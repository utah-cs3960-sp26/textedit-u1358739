// Fixed  When I only use find and replace then exit a file, it doesn't warn me about unsaved changes.
// Fixed  When clicking on edit or view in the menu bar, the shortcut description and the shortcut are sometimes overlapping.
// Fixed  To zoom in I have to press ctrlShift+ instead of just ctrl+.
// Fixed  When I use Replace All it clears the undo history and I can't undo it.

// Fixed  When first opening the text editor it goes off the screen a little until it is repositioned.
// Fixed  When zooming in or out doesn't change the size of the line numbers and they look really bad.
// Fixed  Can't delete files or folders in the side bar.
Can't drag and drop a file or folder into another folder in the side bar.
// Fixed  Can't tell which folder I am in, in the side bar.
// Fixed  No shortcuts for create folder and open folder.

// Fixed  Currently can't change which folder is shown in the side bar.
If something is added to a file then removed, it still shows that the file needs to be saved, but that is what vs code does too.
// Fixed  When zooming, it is impossible to tell if I am back at the default 100% or not.

Scroll bar doesn't look that great.

// Fixed  Sometimes when I open a file and make changes to it, then try to save it then it wants me to choose the file location and name even tho it already should know what it is.
// Fixed  I can't exit the last file inside the text editor.
// Implemented  It would be nice if when no file is opened then it shows two buttons in the center of the screen.  New file and Open File.
// Fixed  When I make changes to a file and it is the only file opened, then when I try to exit then choose save it tries to save it as a new file and asks me for a new filepath and name.
// Fixed  When I make changes to the untitled file that is up at first, then it doesn't save them.
// Made so the cursor is focused on opening a file so the user can immediately start typing.
