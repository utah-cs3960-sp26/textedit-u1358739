// Must
// Implement multifile find and replace.

Should
// Scroll bar doesn't look that great.
// When I press down when I am on the last line, the cursor doesn't go to the end of the line.  It just stays there.
// When the split view button is disabled, then display maximun views reached when hovering over the button.
// Make so if a cursor is on that view, then that view is the active view and when a new file is opened it is opened in that view.
// Make so when a file is already opened and I try to open it in a different view (open it when a different view is active), then it works and now has the file opened twice.

Could
Can't drag and drop a file or folder into another folder in the sidebar.
Can't drag and drop tabs from one view over to another view.
When there are too many tabs in a view it adds arrows that are not that cool.  I want a small horizontal scroll bar instead.
Make so find and replace highlights all instances of the "find" and emphasizes the one that it is currently on.
