// When I press down when I am on the last line, the cursor doesn't go to the end of the line.  It just stays there.
// When the split view button is disabled, then display maximun views reached when hovering over the button.
// Make so if a cursor is on that view, then that view is the active view and when a new file is opened it is opened in that view.
// Make so when a file is already opened and I try to open it in a different view (open it when a different view is active), then it works and now has the file opened twice.

// Can't drag and drop tabs from one view over to another view.

When I click on the split view button when it is disabled then it doesn't show the "Maximum Views Reached" popup.
// The Maximum Views Reached popup is Maximum views reached instead of Maximum Views Reached
// When I make a change in the first default untitled document then undo the change or delete it (the file is not completely empty) then it still shows that it was modified and when exited it still warns me about unsaved changes.
