// Must
// Implement multifile find and replace.

Should
Scroll bar doesn't look that great.
// When I press down when I am on the last line, the cursor doesn't go to the end of the line.  It just stays there.
When the split view button is disabled, then display maximun views reached when hovering over the button.
Make so if a cursor is on that view, then that view is the active view and when a new file is opened it is opened in that view.

Could
Can't drag and drop a file or folder into another folder in the sidebar.
Can't drag and drop tabs from one view over to another view.
When there are too many tabs in a view it adds arrows that are kinda stupid.  I want a small horizontal scroll bar instead.
Make so find and replace highlights all instances of the "find" and emphasizes the one that it is currently on.
